opkg-0.3.0 (in development)
===========================

- Improved testsuite with more tests, `make check` now runs the testsuite and
  exits non-zero if any test fails

- Improved `autogen.sh` script for developers & maintainers, no longer runs
  configure directly. `./autogen.sh --clean` now removes all generated files
  without requiring configure to have been ran

- Renamed `conf` -> `opkg_config` to prevent global symbol clashes

- Added functions `opkg_conf_get_option` and `opkg_conf_set_option`, direct
  access to `options` array is no longer allowed

- Better handling of hold flag on packages

- Added config option `autoremove` equivalent to `--autoremove` command line
  flag

- Added config option `overwrite_no_owner`

- Improved detection and handling of package conflicts

- Only install `opkg-key` when gpg support is enabled

- Support implicit and explicit FTP-over-SSL when curl is enabled

- Improved download caching

- Allow interrupted downloads to be resumed when curl is enabled

  removing possibly critical packages before reinstall (issue 71)
