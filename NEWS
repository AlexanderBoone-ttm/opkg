opkg-0.3.0 (in development)
===========================

User visible:

- opkg now depends on libarchive

- Added config option `autoremove` equivalent to `--autoremove` command line
  flag

- Added config option `overwrite_no_owner` allowing un-owned files to be
  overwritten during package install (issue 99)

- Added config options `connect_timeout_ms`, `transfer_timeout_ms` and
  `follow_location` for use with CURL

- Added command line option `--volatile-cache`

- Support implicit and explicit FTP-over-SSL when curl is enabled

- Improved download caching

- Allow interrupted downloads to be resumed when curl is enabled (issue 115)

- Improved heuristics to determine whether an argument is a package name, remote
  URI or local path

- Improved detection and handling of package conflicts

- Better handling of package flags (such as hold) and status

- Only install `opkg-key` when gpg support is enabled

Developer visible:

- Improved testsuite with more tests, `make check` now runs the testsuite and
  exits non-zero if any test fails

- Improved `autogen.sh` script for developers & maintainers, no longer runs
  configure directly. `./autogen.sh --clean` now removes all generated files
  without requiring configure to have been ran

- Renamed `conf` -> `opkg_config` to prevent global symbol clashes (issue 92)

- Added functions `opkg_conf_get_option` and `opkg_conf_set_option`, direct
  access to `options` array is no longer allowed

- Added documentation in `developer-doc` directory

- Use libarchive to extract packages instead of hand-rolled tar, ar and gzip
  handling (adds dependency on libarchive)

- Remove libbb!

opkg-0.2.2
==========

- Fix '--force-reinstall' flag so that it acts as an upgrade rather than
  removing possibly critical packages before reinstall (issue 71)

- Symlinks are now correctly removed during package uninstall (issue 91)

- Fixed help and manual pages to reflect that shell globs not true regexps are
  accepted by opkg (issue 107)

- The error message "no valid architecture" is no longer given when the
  architecture of a package is valid but incompatible with the current system.

opkg-0.2.1
==========

- Updated AUTHORS, README, CONTRIBUTING, etc

  HAVE_* symbols from all installed headers
