opkg-0.3.0 (in development)
===========================

User visible:

- opkg now depends on libarchive

- Added config option `autoremove` equivalent to `--autoremove` command line
  flag

- Added config option `overwrite_no_owner` allowing un-owned files to be
  overwritten during package install (issue 99)

- Added config options `connect_timeout_ms`, `transfer_timeout_ms` and
  `follow_location` for use with CURL

- Added command line option `--volatile-cache`

- Support implicit and explicit FTP-over-SSL when curl is enabled

- Improved download caching

- Allow interrupted downloads to be resumed when curl is enabled (issue 115)

- Improved heuristics to determine whether an argument is a package name, remote
  URI or local path

- Improved detection and handling of package conflicts

- Better handling of package flags (such as hold) and status

- Only install `opkg-key` when gpg support is enabled

- `update-alternatives` has been moved out of opkg and into opkg-utils

- Only upgrade installed packages during `opkg upgrade` (issue 127)

- Add https proxy support and improve proxy authentication when using the CURL
  backend for downloads.

- Improve package and package feed verification. Signatures can now be checked
  for individual package files if the option `check_pkg_signature` is set (issue
  132).

- Add support for HTTP basic authentication when using the CURL backend for
  downloads.

- Allow both openssl and gpg support to coexist within a single build of opkg.
  The signature verification method is now controlled by the `signature_type`
  option, which defaults to using gpg signatures.

- Add support for ASCII-armored gpg signatures.

- Rename `opkg-cl` to `opkg`.

- Add `lock_file` configuration option. This option replaces the
  `--with-opkglockfile` argument to `./configure`, therefore allowing the lock
  file path to be specified at run-time.

- Drop `--with-opkglibdir` argument to `./configure`. The library directory now
  always defaults to `/var/lib` but the paths to the lists dir, info dir and
  status file may now be separately controlled at runtime. These paths are set by
  the `lists_dir`, `info_dir` and `status_file` options.

- Drop `--with-opkgetcdir` argument to `./configure`. The etc directory is
  always `/etc`, however the OPKG_CONF_DIR environment variable may be set
  before executing opkg to read configuration files from a path other than
  `/etc/opkg`.

- Drop support for the old `lists_dir` option syntax. The new syntax introduced
  in v0.2.3 must now be used.

- The default cache directory is now `/var/cache` (issue 131) but can still be
  changed using the `cache_dir` option.

- Support package filename arguments to `opkg info` (issue 125).

- Correctly handle pacakges which list a virtual package in Provides, Replaces
  and Conflicts (issue 89).

- Ensure that the lock file can be created by creating the parent directory if
  it does not already exist (issue 110).

- Allow pkg-config to be used to find the gpg-error library.

- By default, packages accessed using `file://` URLs are no longer cached as it
  is assumed that they will always be accessible. However, the
  `cache_local_files` option may be set to use the old behaviour and copy local
  files into the cache (issue 139).

- Issue a NOTICE message not an ERROR message if files listed as Conffiles have
  been changed by the user prior to a package upgrade but the `force_maintainer`
  option has not been set (issue 128, part 1).

- Add `ignore_maintainer` option to silently ignore changes to files listed as
  Conffiles during a package upgrade (issue 128, part 2).

- Add `opkg-key reset` command to remove all trusted keys.

- Add `opkg-key populate` command to populated the list of trusted keys using
  the contents of `/usr/share/opkg/keyrings`.

- Improve usage output of `opkg-key`.

- Call prerm and postrm scripts on package upgrade (issue 104).

- Add `no_install_recommends` option and `--no-install-recommends` command line
  argument to prevent the installation of packages listed as Recommends.

- Add `--add-exclude` command line argument to add packages to an exclusion
  list. Packages on this exclusion list will not be installed and an error will
  occur if they are required as dependencies of any other package to be
  installed.

Developer visible:

- Improved testsuite with more tests, `make check` now runs the testsuite and
  exits non-zero if any test fails

- Improved `autogen.sh` script for developers & maintainers, no longer runs
  configure directly. `./autogen.sh --clean` now removes all generated files
  without requiring configure to have been ran

- Renamed `conf` -> `opkg_config` to prevent global symbol clashes (issue 92)

- Added functions `opkg_conf_get_option` and `opkg_conf_set_option`, direct
  access to `options` array is no longer allowed

- Added documentation in `developer-doc` directory

- Use libarchive to extract packages instead of hand-rolled tar, ar and gzip
  handling (adds dependency on libarchive)

- Remove libbb!

- Lots of code refactoring and minor improvements.

- The libopkg API defined in 'libopkg/opkg.c' is deprecated. opkg must be
  configured with the `--enable-libopkg-api` argument to build this API.

- Drop unnecessary source files under 'tests'

- Add `scripts/checkpatch.pl`, adapted from the Linux kernel. This script may be
  used to check that patches match the expected coding style and are free from
  some common mistakes.

- Remove confusing `from_upgrade` argument from `opkg_remove_pkg`.

opkg-0.2.4
==========

- Improve handling of failed installs. Package status is now set to 'install
  reinst-required half-installed' and advice on how to rectify the situation is
  now given.

- Improve handling of upgrades, and fix detection of orphan packages. Orphan
  RECOMMENDS will now be removed during an upgrade, as well as orphan DEPENDS,
  if autoremove is enabled. However, packages which move from DEPENDS to
  RECOMMENDS will now be kept. (issue 144)

- Improve handling of package flags.

- Fix 'opkg whatconflicts'.

- Fix handling of '--force-removal-of-dependent-packages'. (issue 140)

- Fix selection between multiple providers of the same abstract package. (issue
  152)

- Fix uname and gname caching during package extraction.

- Fix verification of release metadata files.

- Fix possible segfault in 'pkg_hash_fetch_conflicts()'.

- Use 'sh' instead of 'bash' as the interpreter for 'opkg-check-config'.

opkg-0.2.3
==========

- New, optional syntax for setting lists_dir in config files. This new syntax
  will be required in v0.3.0 and later, the old syntax is now deprecated. The
  new syntax is:

    option lists_dir <path>

- New 'opkg-check-config' helper script to check and update config files.
  Currently this just changes the old lists_dir syntax to the new syntax.

- Add the 'combine' option and '--combine' command line argument. These options
  combine the installation or upgrade of multiple packages so that dependency
  evaluation is carried out for the whole transaction rather than separately for
  each package. This resolves the case of issue 124 where multiple packages
  depend on a common package with version constraints in such a way that all
  dependent packages need to be upgraded together.

- Don't select packages for installation which break the dependencies of already
  installed packages (issue 124).

- Fix epoch:version split so that a colon is only interpreted as the epoch
  separator in a version string if it is the first non-numeric character.

- Fix package flags after failed upgrade. This ensures that subsequent
  installs or upgrades do not consider the old package as scheduled for removal.

- Prevent packages listed in RECOMMENDS of an installed package from being
  removed automatically when autoremove is set.

- Fix 'extern "C"' wrapping in header files.

- Improve check for gpgme in configure script. Now either pkg-config or
  gpgme-config can be used to find gpgme.

- Fix internal usage of 'config.h', this ensures building opkg and its
  dependencies with large file support will work correctly.

- Fix internal memory leaks and suboptimal code.

opkg-0.2.2
==========

- Fix '--force-reinstall' flag so that it acts as an upgrade rather than
  removing possibly critical packages before reinstall (issue 71)

- Symlinks are now correctly removed during package uninstall (issue 91)

- Fixed help and manual pages to reflect that shell globs not true regexps are
  accepted by opkg (issue 107)

- The error message "no valid architecture" is no longer given when the
  architecture of a package is valid but incompatible with the current system.

opkg-0.2.1
==========

- Updated AUTHORS, README, CONTRIBUTING, etc

- Dropped "config.h" from the list of installed headers and removed checks for
  HAVE_* symbols from all installed headers

- Made libopkg usable from C++ via `extern "C"` wrapping

opkg-0.2.0
==========

- No changes

opkg-0.2.0-rc2
==============

- Remove libopkg/config.h from the distribution archive, it's generated by
  configure and doesn't belong in there

opkg-0.2.0-rc1
==============

- Added basic regression test suite

- Added man pages for opkg-cl and opkg-key

- Added the `overlay_root` config option

- Added the `list-changed-conffiles` command

- Added the `opkg_compare_versions` function to libopkg

- Allow external gunzip binary to be used to perform decompression if the
  OPKG_USE_VFORK environment variable is set

- Do not read /etc/opkg/*.conf if -f option is specified

- Detect and handle circular dependencies

- Replaced GPLv3+ licensed sha256 implementation with GPLv2+ implementation

- Use `ln -snf` rather than `ln -sf` in update-alternatives

- Many other bugfixes, improvements and cleanups...
